A common place to put learning material surrounding all that is Python.

## Setup
Below are the steps to get going with this repo:
- Clone this directory.
- Ensure that you have Python 3 installed.  If not, please do so first.  If your version is not 3.8, you will need to update the Pipfile to reflect your version.
- Make sure you have `pipenv` installed.  If not, you can do this by running `pip install pipenv` on your command line.
- Start a virtual environment.  You do this with `pipenv shell` from this repos directory.
- Once in the virtual environment, run `pipenv install` to install all of the dependencies needed.
- You can now start your notebook.  Run `jupyter-lab`.  This will take you to a web browser in your Jupyter Lab instance.
